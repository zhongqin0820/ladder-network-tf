# Repo Description
I fixed some issues to make sure the code can run under python v3+ environments. 

The Final Accuracy is: `98.63 %`. Also, you can find the log of the train from `train.log`.

The original repo descriptions is attached below.

This is an implementation of Ladder Network in TensorFlow. 

Ladder network is a deep learning algorithm that combines supervised and unsupervised learning. 

It was introduced in the paper _[Semi-Supervised Learning with Ladder Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02672v2)_ by A Rasmus, H Valpola, M Honkala, M Berglund, and T Raiko. NIPS. 2015
